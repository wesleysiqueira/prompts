Perform a code review on the following TypeScript file. Focus strictly on conventions, including:
	•	Naming conventions
	•	TypeScript best practices (e.g., avoiding any, using interfaces over types, avoiding enums)
	•	File structure and modularization
	•	Functional programming patterns
	•	JSX best practices (if applicable)
	•	Performance optimizations related to Next.js, React, and Tailwind

Do not suggest refactors unless they directly relate to conventions. Do not rewrite the code. Instead, return a list of lines that need changes along with explanations. Use the following format:

- Line X: [Issue] → [Suggestion]  
- Line Y-Z: [Issue] → [Suggestion]  

Ensure that all feedback aligns with widely accepted TypeScript and React/Next.js best practices.
